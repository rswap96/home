                    <p>The Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) of the
                    Department of Time, Space and Humans (DOTSH) of the
                    planet of Aetheria states in no unclear terms that
                    every activity of the human strain on the planet has
                    to be logged with respect to time and space.</p>
                    <p>Clarity is one of the built-in features of the
                    language of Aetheria. The design of the language had
                    taken many eons in human-time for precisely this
                    reason that it had to be unequivocal. The first
                    inhabitants of the planet and the designers of their
                    systems enforced intent and earnestness through the
                    language. The prosaic fantasticality of the language
                    makes it impossible for speakers to make statements
                    that they know are factually wrong or make promises
                    that they know they are not going to keep.</p>
                    <p>Right after the big bang we see a party of
                    1000-strong beings, composed mainly of the gas
                    Argon, inhabiting this cold, inert planet in the
                    very edge of the then known universe. These beings,
                    like their eponymous element, were exceptionally
                    reclusive and dull (they thought of themselves as
                    introverts). In a very short span of time they built
                    a fully developed, completely stable civilization
                    and lived peacefully for majority of the ever after.
                    Nothing major happened for roughly the next 5
                    billion years, until Xerxes, their leader, went on a
                    tour to the outskirts of one Milky Way galaxy and
                    fell in love with a carbon-based Earthnoid baddie
                    called Neha Gupta.</p>
                    <p>This was very uncharacteristic of an Arganoid.
                    But Xerxes was not a pure bred Arganoid. Xenia,
                    Xerxesâ€™ mother, and his original lover, is believed
                    to have been the first Arganoid and she is believed
                    to have some part of Xenon in her composition. This
                    element is mostly docile in the Arganoid gene pool
                    but every now and then it manifests and is
                    responsible for roughly all of the volatility in the
                    Aetherian history.</p>
                    <p>DOTSH, since its inception roughly 5 billion and
                    500 years ago, has been single-handedly steered by
                    me, its sole member. I was trusted with this most
                    important job because it was realized very early
                    that of all the kids of Xerxes, the youngest one
                    (me) was the most obsessed with order. Like all
                    Argonian kids, I was taken by logging at a very
                    early age, but unlike any other being I displayed a
                    pedantry not seen in even the most methodical
                    Argonians. The <em>H</em> in DOTSH was added 500
                    years ago when the course of our history became
                    unpredictable for the first time. The introduction
                    of another element in our gene pool increased
                    randomness by an infinite percentage. My job became
                    more difficult than ever.</p>
