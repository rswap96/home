<p>Given that things are worth doing and one is skilled, honest and
brave enough to pursue action, there are three fundamental questions
that need to be addressed - <strong>what, why and how</strong> to go
about this often noble - but always valiant - enterprise of action.</p>
<p>The <strong>What</strong> is an important question in that it
reflects what the doer deems as the most pertinent and valuable thing to
do among all the things that can be done. The hero then refers
established wisdom, seeks mentorship and summons the internet to devise
a plan of action - the <strong>How</strong>. This scheming, popularly
perceived as one of the most important things, often amounts to very
little (if anything), because thinking is worth nothing and doing is
worth everything.</p>
<p>In this post, I argue that the cardinal question to dwell upon is
<strong>Why</strong><a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> - or the correct motivations for
action. We will evaluate all the popular <u>ends</u> and decide:</p>
<ul class="incremental">
<li>Which <u>ends</u> are more <u>valuable</u> than others (yes, some
ends are, in fact, objectively, <strong>greater</strong> than other
ends)</li>
<li>Which <u>value systems</u> are <u>superior</u></li>
</ul>
<p>I will also touch why I think a well-formulated, individualistic
value system is indispensable for leading a meaningful life. All of
this, ultimately, rests upon the assumption that you are interested in
leading a meaningful life and that such a thing and such a life actually
exists.</p>
<p><u><strong>Regardless of everything</strong></u> - action is sacred
and it should be preferred over all kinds of non-action, irrespective of
whether you have a system of values or a set of higher ends, because
(spoilers alert!) I conclude that the highest possible end is…</p></div>

                    - Should you read this post?; Will this make you
                    ‘better’?</h3>
                    <p><strong>It’s not, you shouldn’t and no it
                    won’t</strong>. This discussion is entirely devoid
                    of any real-world or any other world utility…well,
                    at least to most people. For me it underscores
                    everything I decide to do (and more importantly -
                    not to do) in my life. This would sound gibberish to
                    you if you have never thought along these lines.</p>
                    <p>I spent the most exciting time of my life
                    studying accounting, costing and taxation. I hated
                    almost every second of it. I was interested in
                    everything else but this (isn’t this always the
                    case? :p) - literature, cinema, science,
                    computers…The objective of my efforts were very
                    clear to me at every stage, at a micro level - the
                    specifics of doing well in a course. I did it in the
                    best possible way. But I had no good reason of doing
                    any of it apart from the reason that something needs
                    to be done.</p>
                    <p>Barring survival and duty I don’t see any other
                    reason for you to do something that don’t make you
                    forget (and even relish) the morbidness of
                    existence. This only makes sense if you actually
                    think your time and life valuable.</p>
                    <pre><code>I make case for this general approach:
&gt; You have to decide to do something 
&gt; You check your long-term aims 
&gt; You have a hierarchy of values &gt; 

As against this more prevalent one:
&gt; You have to decide to do something 
&gt; You consult the contemporary list of honorable and desirable aims
&gt; You pick one end based on its community value and your convenience

                    <h2 id="a-bold-assumption">A Bold Assumption</h2>
                    <p>All of this post (and everything else) assumes
                    that -</p>
                    <ol class="incremental" type="1">
                    <li>Things/actions have <em>value</em></li>
                    <li>Some things/actions are more <em>valuable</em>
                    than others</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>This is a dangerous assumption that is far from
                    obvious.<br />
                    - It is not certain that doing things other than for
                    survival is inherently valuable - The case for
                    action is weak - Given no justice system or moral
                    conscience - there’s absolutely no reason to do the
                    right thing (or to do anything at all) - We should
                    be aware of this before venturing any further - In
                    light of this it becomes very important for us to
                    recognize our motivations and assess which are
                    better than others - This of course will only make
                    sense to you if you think some things are
                    better/more valuable than some other things and vice
                    versa</p>

                    quo</a> is a very nice song by Daft Punk from the
                    album <a
                    href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdw1JeDjWH8">Discovery</a>.
                    “Veridis Quo” is a bit of clever wordplay on the
                    Latin phrase “Quo vadis?”, literally, “Whither goest
                    thou?” or “Where are you going?”. The greater
                    meaning of the phrase is, “To what purpose?” or, “To
                    what end are you doing this?” There is a Christian
                    usage of this phrase, asked to Jesus. Read in a
                    slightly different way, it reads, dis-quo-very - the
                    name of the album and also “disco very” - which can
                    also be a worthy motivation from the list of
                    available motivations for doing anything.<a
