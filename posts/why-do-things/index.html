<p>Given that things are worth doing and one is skilled, honest and
brave enough to pursue action, there are three fundamental questions
that need to be addressed - <strong>what, why and how</strong> to go
about this often noble - but always valiant - enterprise of action.</p>
<p>The <strong>What</strong> is an important question in that it
reflects what the doer deems as the most pertinent and valuable thing to
do among all the things that can be done. The hero then refers
established wisdom, seeks mentorship and summons the internet to devise
a plan of action - the <strong>How</strong>. This scheming, popularly
perceived as one of the most important things, often amounts to very
little (if anything), because thinking is worth nothing and doing is
worth everything.</p>
<p>In this post, I argue that the cardinal question to dwell upon is
<strong>Why</strong><a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> - or the correct motivations for
action. Note that this is different from that existential question of
“Why do things when nothing matters”. We will evaluate all the popular
<u>ends</u> and decide:</p>
<ul class="incremental">
<li>Which <u>ends</u> are more <u>valuable</u> than others (yes, some
ends are, in fact, objectively, <strong>greater</strong> than other
ends)</li>
<li>Which <u>value systems</u> are <u>superior</u></li>
</ul>
<p>I compare this with another popular mode of operation - the famous
Fucking Around and Finding Out [FAFO]. FAFO is complementary to my
recommendation because here the ends are as pure as the they can get.
But I have noticed that nobody FAFOs without being affected by other
sinister and plebian aims that slowly and surely seep in.</p>
<p>I will also touch upon why I think a well-formulated, individualistic
value system is indispensable for leading a meaningful life. All of
this, ultimately, rests upon the assumption that you are interested in
leading a meaningful life and that such a life actually exists.</p>
<p><u><strong>Regardless of everything</strong></u> - action is sacred
and it should be preferred over all kinds of non-action, irrespective of
whether you have a system of values or a set of higher ends or a mode of
operation.</p></div>

                    relevant?</h2>
                    <p><strong>It’s not</strong>. This discussion is
                    entirely devoid of any real-world or any other world
                    utility…well, at least to most people. For me it
                    underscores everything I decide to do (and more
                    importantly - not to do) in my life. This would
                    sound gibberish to you if you have never thought
                    along these lines.</p>
                    <p>I spent the most exciting time of my life
                    studying accounting, costing and taxation. I hated
                    almost every second of it. I was interested in
                    everything else but this (isn’t this always the
                    case? :p) - literature, cinema, science, computers…
                    My reasons for doing this were valid - I had no idea
                    what I actually wanted and I knew what I definitely
                    didn’t want. I knew that I didn’t want to slog for
                    competitive exams even though I was decent at math
                    and science. I would attribute this post and this
                    obsession with whys to that period of 5 years when I
                    was in immense misery. Five years is a small price
                    to pay to wake up.</p>
                    <p>Barring survival and duty I don’t see any other
                    reason for you to do something that doesn’t make you
                    forget (and eventually relish) the morbidness of
                    existence. Now whatever I do - after I have ensured
                    my survival - is very conscious and at my terms.
                    After completing mandatory education, I haven’t read
                    a single thing that I didn’t want to read and
                    undertaken a pursuit I didn’t <em>really</em> want
                    to pursue.a</p>
                    <p>The prevalent modus operandi for every decision
                    is something like this:</p>
                    <blockquote>
                    <ul class="incremental">
                    <li>A decision needs to be made w.r.t doing
                    something<br />
                    </li>
                    <li>You consult the contemporary list of honorable,
                    desirable and fashionable aims/ends<br />
                    </li>
                    <li>You pick one based on its contemporary
                    <em>community</em> prestige, your parents’ dreams
                    and as per your convenience</li>
                    </ul>
                    </blockquote>
                    <p>I make case for this general approach:</p>
                    <blockquote>
                    <ul class="incremental">
                    <li>A decision needs to be made w.r.t doing
                    something<br />
                    </li>
                    <li>You have a ever-evolving, painfully, laboriously
                    and consciously curated hierarchy of values - a
                    system of meaning<br />
                    </li>
                    <li>You decide based on what you deem most
                    meaningful</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2 id="a-bold-assumption">A Bold Assumption</h2>
                    <p>All of this post (and everything else) assumes
                    that -</p>
                    <ol class="incremental" type="1">
                    <li>Things/actions have <em>value</em></li>
                    <li>Some things/actions are more <em>valuable</em>
                    than others</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>This is a dangerous assumption that is far from
                    obvious.<br />
                    - It is not certain that doing things other than for
                    survival is inherently valuable - The case for
                    action is weak - Given no justice system or moral
                    conscience - there’s absolutely no reason to do the
                    right thing (or to do anything at all) - We should
                    be aware of this before venturing any further - In
                    light of this it becomes very important for us to
                    recognize our motivations and assess which are
                    better than others - This of course will only make
                    sense to you if you think some things are
                    better/more valuable than some other things and vice
                    versa</p>

                    href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdw1JeDjWH8">Discovery</a>.
                    “Veridis Quo” is a bit of clever wordplay on the
                    Latin phrase “Quo vadis?”, literally, “Whither goest
                    thou?” or “Where are you going?”. The greater
                    meaning of the phrase is, “To what purpose?” or, “To
                    what end are you doing this?” There is a Christian
                    usage of this phrase, asked to Jesus. Read in a
                    slightly different way, it reads, dis-quo-very - the
                    name of the album and also “disco very” - which can
                    also be a worthy motivation from the list of
                    available motivations for doing anything.<a
