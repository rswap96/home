<p>Given that things are worth doing and one is skilled, honest and
brave enough to pursue action, there are three fundamental questions
that need to be addressed - <strong>what, why and how</strong> to go
about this often noble - but always valiant - enterprise of action.</p>
<p>The <strong>What</strong> is an important question in that it
reflects what the doer deems as the most pertinent and valuable thing to
do among all the things that can be done. The hero then refers
established wisdom, seeks mentorship and summons the internet to devise
a plan of action - the <strong>How</strong>. This scheming, popularly
perceived as one of the most important things, often amounts to very
little (if anything), because thinking is worth nothing and doing is
worth everything.</p>
<p>In this post, I argue that the cardinal question to dwell upon is
<strong>Why</strong><a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> - or the correct motivations for
action. <span style="color: darkred;"> <strong>Note that this is
different from that existential question of “Why do things when nothing
matters”</strong></span>. We will evaluate all the popular <u>ends</u>
and decide:</p>
<ul class="incremental">
<li>Which <u>ends</u> are more <u>valuable</u> than others (yes, some
ends are, in fact, objectively, <strong>greater</strong> than other
ends)</li>
<li>Which <u>value systems</u> are <u>superior</u></li>
</ul>
<p>I compare my findings with another popular mode of operation - the
famous <u>Fucking Around and Finding Out [FAFO]</u>. FAFO is
complementary to my recommendation because FAFOing ensures that ends
are, at least, not wrong. But I have noticed that nobody FAFOs without
being affected by other sinister and plebian aims that slowly and surely
seep in.</p>
<p>I will also touch upon why I think a well-formulated, individualistic
value system is indispensable for leading a meaningful life. All of
this, ultimately, rests upon the assumption that you are interested in
leading a meaningful life and that such a life actually exists.</p>
<p><u><strong>Regardless of everything</strong></u> - action is sacred
and it should be preferred over all kinds of non-action, irrespective of
whether you have a system of values or a set of higher ends or a mode of
operation.</p></div>

                    <p><strong>It’s probably not</strong>. You should
                    probably just <a href="#tldr">tl;dr</a> or jump to
                    <a href="#faqs">faqs</a>. This discussion is
                    entirely devoid of any real-world or any other world
                    <em>utility</em>…well, at least for most people. For
                    me it underscores everything I decide to do (and
                    more importantly - not to do) in my life.</p>
                    <p>I attribute my obsession with <em>whys</em> to
                    the five years I spent in utter misery studying
                    accounting, taxation and costing. I did very well in
                    the first two years but when every new achievement
                    made me marginally sadder I knew that something was
                    wrong. I didn’t fully comprehend it then but I
                    stopped doing things that I knew were not going to
                    bring me joy. Five years of solitude and suffering
                    is the price for developing a bespoke taste, a
                    custom-made fully-owned hierarchy of the world. Five
                    years of slavery is the cost to properly price
                    freedom.</p>

                    <p>Barring survival and duty I don’t see any other
                    reason for you to do something that doesn’t make you
                    forget (and eventually relish) the morbidness of
                    existence. These days whatever I do - after I have
                    safeguarded my survival - is very conscious and at
                    my terms. I have have the luxury of choice and if
                    you don’t you should stop reading this post. After
                    completing mandatory education, I haven’t read a
                    single thing that I didn’t want to read and or
                    pursued anything that I didn’t <em>really</em>
                    want.</p>
                    <p>The prevalent modus operandi for every decision
                    is something like this:</p>
                    <blockquote>
                    <ul class="incremental">
                    <li>A decision needs to be made w.r.t doing
                    something<br />
                    </li>
                    <li>You consult the contemporary list of honorable,
                    desirable and fashionable aims/ends<br />
                    </li>
                    <li>You pick one based on its contemporary
                    <em>community</em> prestige, your parents’ dreams
                    and as per your convenience</li>
                    </ul>
                    </blockquote>
                    <p>I make case for this general approach:</p>
                    <blockquote>
                    <ul class="incremental">
                    <li>A decision needs to be made w.r.t doing
                    something<br />
                    </li>
                    <li>You have a ever-evolving, painfully, laboriously
                    and consciously curated hierarchy of values - a
                    system of meaning<br />
                    </li>
                    <li>You decide based on what you deem most

                    No, and I try to. I have always strived for fame
                    (which is a form of validation) and will likely
                    always do that. Part of being anonymous is to curb
                    this self importance and synthetically remove all
                    the vile ends that are there to serve the self and
                    focus on the object of my actions - like this post.

                    <p>All of this post (and also life, universe and
                    everything else) assumes that -</p>
                    <ol class="incremental" type="1">
                    <li>Things/actions have <em>value</em></li>
                    <li>Some things/actions are more <em>valuable</em>
                    than others</li>
                    <li>And that <em>pursuit</em> of valuable things is
                    desirable</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>This is a dangerous assumption that is far from
                    obvious.<br />
                    - It is not certain that doing things other than for
                    survival is inherently valuable - The case for
                    action is weak - Given no justice system or moral
                    conscience - there’s absolutely no reason to do the
                    right thing (or to do anything at all) - We should
                    be aware of this before venturing any further - In
                    light of this it becomes very important for us to
                    recognize our motivations and assess which are
                    better than others - This of course will only make
                    sense to you if you think some things are
                    better/more valuable than some other things and vice
                    versa</p>

                    <p>I spent weeks designing this site, setting up a
                    static site build and automatic composition process
                    for what?</p>
                    <p>I fought the urge to try and <em>make something
                    come out of it</em>. A personal site is an
                    exhibition of your work and skills usually
                    maintained with an objective of attracting
                    professional suitors and build productive liaisons.
                    The posts are a formality - something that has to be
                    done to demonstrate basic competence and establish
                    base-level legitimacy.</p>

                    quo</a> is a very nice song by Daft Punk from the

                    href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdw1JeDjWH8">Discovery</a>.
                    “Veridis Quo” is a bit of clever wordplay on the
                    Latin phrase “Quo vadis?”, literally, “Whither goest
                    thou?” or “Where are you going?”. The greater
                    meaning of the phrase is, “To what purpose?” or, “To
                    what end are you doing this?” There is a Christian
                    usage of this phrase, asked to Jesus. Read in a
                    slightly different way, it reads, dis-quo-very - the
                    name of the album and also “disco very” - which can
                    also be a worthy motivation from the list of
                    available motivations for doing anything.<a
