                    <div class="summary"><p>Given that things are worth
doing and one is skilled, honest and brave enough to pursue action,
there are three fundamental questions that need to be addressed -
<strong>what, why and how</strong> to go about this often noble - but
always valiant - enterprise of action.</p>
<p>The <strong>What</strong> is an important question in that it
reflects what the doer deems as the most pertinent and valuable thing to
do among all the things that can be done. The hero then refers
established wisdom, seeks mentorship and summons the internet to devise
a plan of action - the <strong>How</strong>. This scheming, popularly
perceived as one of the most important things, often amounts to very
little (if anything), because thinking is worth nothing and doing is
worth everything.</p>
<p>In this post, I argue that the cardinal question to dwell upon is
<strong>Why</strong><a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> - or the correct motivations for
action. <span style="color: darkred;"> <strong>Note that this is
different from that existential question of “Why do things when nothing
matters”</strong></span>. We will evaluate all the popular <u>ends</u>
and decide:</p>
<ul class="incremental">
<li>Which <u>ends</u> are more <u>valuable</u> than others (yes, some
ends are, in fact, objectively, <strong>greater</strong> than other
ends)</li>
<li>Which <u>value systems</u> are <u>superior</u></li>
</ul>
<p>I compare my findings with another popular mode of operation - the
famous <u>Fucking Around and Finding Out [FAFO]</u>. FAFO is
complementary to my recommendation because FAFOing ensures that ends
are, at least, not wrong. But I have noticed that nobody FAFOs without
being affected by other sinister and plebian aims that slowly and surely
seep in.</p>
<p>All of this, ultimately, rests upon the assumption that you are
interested in leading a meaningful life and that such a life actually
exists.</p>
<p><u><strong>Regardless of everything</strong></u> - action is sacred
and it should be preferred over all kinds of non-action, irrespective of
whether you have a system of values or a set of higher ends or a mode of
operation.</p></div>

                    <p><strong>It’s probably not</strong>. You should
                    probably just <a href="#tldr">tl;dr</a> or jump to
                    <a href="#faqs">faqs</a>. This discussion is
                    entirely devoid of any real-world or any other world
                    <em>utility</em>…well, at least for most people. For
                    me it underscores everything I decide to do (and
                    more importantly - not to do) in my life.</p>
                    <p>I attribute my obsession with <em>whys</em> to
                    the five years I spent in utter misery studying
                    accounting, taxation and costing. I did very well in
                    the first two years but when every new achievement
                    made me marginally sadder I knew that something was
                    wrong. I didn’t fully comprehend it then but I
                    stopped doing things that I knew were not going to
                    bring me joy. Five years of solitude and suffering
                    is the price for developing a bespoke taste,
                    <strong>a custom-made, fully-owned</strong>
                    hierarchy of the world. Five years of slavery is the
                    cost to properly price freedom.</p>

                    <p>Barring survival and duty I don’t see any other
                    reason for you to do something that doesn’t make you
                    forget (and eventually relish) the morbidness of
                    existence. These days whatever I do - after I have
                    ensured my survival - is very conscious and at my
                    terms. I have the luxury of choice and if you don’t
                    you should stop reading this post. After completing
                    mandatory education, I haven’t read a single thing
                    that I didn’t want to read or pursued anything that
                    I didn’t <em>really</em> want to pursue.</p>
                    <p>The prevalent modus operandi for decision making
                    is something like this:</p>
                    <div class="box invert center">
                    <blockquote>
                    <ul class="incremental">
                    <li>A decision needs to be made w.r.t doing
                    something<br />
                    </li>
                    <li>You consult the contemporary list of honorable,
                    desirable and fashionable aims/ends<br />
                    </li>
                    <li>You pick one based on its contemporary
                    <em>community</em> prestige, your parents’ dreams,
                    your convenience etc.</li>

                    <p>I make case for this general approach:</p>

                    No, and I try to. I have always strived for fame
                    (which is a form of validation) and will likely
                    always do that. Part of being anonymous is to curb
                    this self importance and synthetically remove all
                    the vile ends that are there to serve the self and
                    focus on the object of my actions - like this post.

                    <p>All of this post (and also life, universe and
                    everything else) assumes that -</p>
                    <ol class="incremental" type="1">
                    <li>Things/actions have <em>value</em></li>
                    <li>Some things/actions are more <em>valuable</em>

                    <li>And that <em>pursuit</em> of valuable things is
                    desirable</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>These are not as matter-of-fact as they appear.
                    The will to life is the only real and natural
                    fundamental force. Survival is the only thing with
                    any intrinsic value. Not dying is the sacred and the
                    <em>only</em> divinely ordained duty of the living.
                    All the contraption that we see around us is to
                    optimize this singular end. What is left to do then
                    when this end is secured? debauchery, because
                    <em>nothing</em> is not an option for most
                    people.</p>
                    <h3 id="a-moot-point"><u>a moot point</u></h3>
                    <p>At the same time it is a moot point spending too
                    much time dwelling on this because even if life is a
                    futile exercise devoid of any higher meaning how do
                    you plan on spending your time? You have no choice
                    because time needs to be filled. The sake of having
                    fun is sake enough and boredom is reason enough for
                    doing things. Doing is the best anesthetic to
                    despair, because thinking is the cause of all the
                    pain and doing is an escape from thinking.</p>

                    <p>If this is so obvious why do I have to tell this
                    to myself again and again? Because the case for
                    action is weak and only self-delusion and
                    gaslighting can push us to do hard things once
                    shelter, game and mate is secured. All of societal
                    infra emanates unconsciously precisely from this
                    issue. A buffet of very potent games have emerged
                    naturally to address this problem. You, sweet
                    reader, is sure to perform poorly in these games
                    because you have committed blasphemy of breaking the
                    fourth wall and questioning the rules and the need
                    for these games.</p>
                    <p>The playing field is skewed sharply towards those
                    who have never questioned the merit of their
                    borrowed beliefs. They are healthier, happier and
                    better at sex than you ever will be. They will sleep
                    sounder sleeps and feel more content by excelling at
                    games with constrained and defined rules, never
                    venturing into the territories of whys and relying
                    on the robustness of time-tested motivators.</p>
                    <p>What is in store for you (and me) then? Does
                    being bad at games make us special? Can we devise
                    our own games? What will happen if no one chooses to
                    play with us? Would we still need their
                    validation?</p>
                    <p>The synthesis of a new set of ends is
                    <em>extremely</em> hard, if not impossible. It is
                    hard because it stands on <em><a
                    href="#bold-assumptions">very shaky
                    assumptions</a></em>.</p>

                    This Post &amp; This Site</h2>
                    <p>I spent weeks designing this site, setting up a
                    static site build and automatic composition process
                    - for what?</p>
                    <p>I fought the urge to try and <em>make something
                    come out of it</em>. A personal site is an
                    exhibition of your work and skills and is maintained
                    with an objective of attracting professional suitors
                    and build productive liaisons. The posts are a
                    formality - something that has to be done to
                    demonstrate basic competence and establish
                    base-level legitimacy.</p>
                    <p>I don’t think these are the best set of aims to
                    come up with the best quality post. The writing of
                    the post should be divorced from the accolades it
                    might bring. I spent the first twenty five years of
                    my life thinking about how the things I build will
                    be received by others. I would fantasize who would
                    shower me with what praise and how I would
                    react.</p>
                    <p>If the post is the end, all other ends will have
                    automatically been achieved, sooner or later, in
                    some form or the other. But even this line of
                    thinking is not optimal. As soon as you start
                    fantasizing about the fruits of your action you can
                    be sure that they are not going to materialize, like
                    the Schrödinger’s cat, but opposite.</p>
                    <p>But is aiming for nothing but the perfect
                    execution of the task strong enough to move us to
                    the kind of erudition required? What were the
                    masters thinking when they were working on their
                    magnum opuses? Were they imagining the glory that
                    awaited them? the cheers of the crowd? the
                    recognition of their peers?</p>
                    <p>It seems like they were driven singularly by the
                    <em>quest for truth</em>, and even more by their
                    <em>inexorable curiosity</em>.</p>

                    <p>My motivations are not nearly pure enough and

                    <h2 id="evaluation-of-ends">Evaluation of Ends</h2>
                    <p>I think <strong>money</strong> is a reasonable
                    end given the immense leverage it can afford in
                    pursuing other, <em>non-utilitarian</em>, ends.
                    However, almost nobody whose primary motivation is
                    money, is working towards earning <em>enough</em>
                    money. Some are working to earn more than their
                    peers, some more than everybody else. In most cases
                    money is a proxy for other more stronger desires,
                    like status, respect, approval, validation, fame and
                    power. I still find money a more benign force than
                    the craving for status, because it is, after all,
                    aimed at self-sufficiency.</p>
                    <p>The <strong>status</strong>-philes (or the
                    <em>laal batti</em> fanatics) are more sinister and
                    insidious. Making money is not enough to compensate
                    for their insecurities. The desire for status is
                    also the desire for power. And what is power if
                    there is no one to exercise it over? So the
                    motivation is not power in the absolute sense, it is
                    power over other people. Among all the ends I find
                    this to be most petty, unproductive and unworthy of
                    human efforts.</p>
                    <p><strong>Education</strong> is not a real end in
                    India. It is always a front for some other dull aim
                    like money, status or safety. It scores big in
                    people’s value chains because it secures safety. I
                    have not met a single person who actually seriously
                    treated eduction as an end in itself. The more
                    number of prestigious colleges in a resume the more
                    weakly developed are their own beliefs. There is a
                    smugness and a complacency in the faces and
                    attitudes of the highly educated. This kind of
                    conviction can only come with complete a subjugation
                    and bankruptcy of owned beliefs and outsourcing
                    beliefs to outside ideals (but this saves the
                    overhead of thinking and helps in achieving other
                    <em>worldly</em> goals). Educational qualification
                    is a signal of existence of competence at some span
                    in time. Competence is worth little. It is often a
                    net negative. We don’t know what drove that person
                    to their achievements. Maybe it was mindless
                    execution of the protocols of the coaching classes.
                    All of this reveals nothing about the
                    insubordination of minds and the freedom of
                    thoughts.</p>
                    <p><strong>Knowledge and understanding</strong> are
                    nobler than organized education because here the
                    subject at least has some autonomy and is not just
                    following a system-defined action plan to fulfill
                    some other hidden motivation. For the first time in
                    our analysis of ends, the focus shifts from the doer
                    to the doee. Or does it? I don’t think so. Not
                    completely. Knowledge is again a survival aid,
                    accumulated with the aim that it would come handy
                    some day. In some quiz or to maneuver out of some
                    obscure eventuality.</p>
                    <p><strong>Respect, recognition and their more
                    flamboyant relative, fame</strong>, don’t seem as
                    toxic to me as money, status and power. These imply
                    that the person has outsourced their worth and
                    valuation to the council of the public. You can
                    safely assume that the public has no valuation
                    methodology of their own derivation. Developing guts
                    to self evaluate and respecting your judgement is
                    hard and so people succumb to the evaluation of the
                    mob. It is strange that the more I obsess about
                    <em>things other than myself</em>, the more
                    confident I get of my own worth.</p>
                    <p>I am apprehensive about the <strong>no defined
                    end</strong> cases. Maybe you don’t know what you
                    want, that does not mean that you don’t want
                    anything. Things only happen because a different
                    state is more desirable than the current state. I
                    also share similar skepticism about the
                    <strong>fun</strong> and <strong>curiosity</strong>
                    motivations. Nobody does anything hard solely for
                    fun. I don’t have anything against curiosity, except
                    that it is unserious (or not serious enough). “What
                    is the need to be serious?” you ask. There’s no
                    need. It depends on how <em>important</em> you think
                    your ideals are.</p>
                    <p>All of the above motivations are influenced and
                    corrupted frequently by the volatility of the
                    libido, that horny agent of the will to life. I
                    would say that you can attribute more than half of
                    any motivation of every person at any time to the
                    <em>horns</em>. This percentage vary widely from
                    subject to subject but is always the dominant
                    force.</p>
                    <p>In light of all of this, what do <em>I</em> think
                    we should work toward?</p>

                    Will is a sux, it's a faux, it's a jox. Growth is
                    subliminal, latent, unconscious. It is only there
                    when you are not looking. It happens when the brute
                    animal motives are tame and subdued and the divine
                    takes over. Or the flow state, in normie-speak.

                    quo</a> is a very nice song by Daft Punk from the
                    album <a

                    “Veridis Quo” is a bit of clever wordplay on the
                    Latin phrase “Quo vadis?”, literally, “Whither goest
                    thou?” or “Where are you going?”. The greater
                    meaning of the phrase is, “To what purpose?” or, “To
                    what end are you doing this?” There is a Christian
                    usage of this phrase, asked to Jesus. Read in a
                    slightly different way, it reads, dis-quo-very - the
                    name of the album and also “disco very” - which can
                    also be a worthy motivation from the list of
                    available motivations for doing anything.<a

                    FAFO</strong><br />
                    Fucking Around and Finding Out is mostly never about
                    fucking or finding. It is about preparing for the
                    next employment. This is not a problem in itself,
                    but posing as a tinkerer and hacker to the public
                    during this phase with the aim of developing a
                    <em>portfolio</em> is not exactly FAFO. There is a
                    very good argument against my idealistic stand that
                    if false aims result in useful outcomes then the
                    ends are justified. This is a very good point, as is
                    every point when making case for opportunism. And
                    that probably is also a valid mode of operation.<a
