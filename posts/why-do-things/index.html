                    <div class="summary"><p><strong>Given that things
are worth doing</strong> and one is skilled, honest and brave enough to
pursue action, there are three fundamental questions that need to be
addressed - what, why and how to go about this often noble - but always
valiant - enterprise of action.</p>
<p>The <strong>What</strong> is an important question in that it
reflects what the doer deems as the most pertinent and valuable thing to
do among all the things that can be done. The hero then refers
established wisdom, seeks mentorship and summons the internet to devise
a plan of action - the <strong>How</strong>. This scheming, popularly
perceived as one of the most important things, often amounts to very
little (if anything), because thinking is worth nothing and doing is
worth everything.</p>
<p>In this post, I argue that the most pertinent question to dwell upon
is <strong>Why</strong><a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> - or the correct motivations for
action. We will evaluate all the popular <u>ends</u> and decide which
ends align best with our set of values. Not all values are worth the
same and I make a case for my top</p>
<p>Obviously the ideal thing to do would be to just skip this post and
all the mental masturbation, turn off the internet and get right down to
some action, but you are here and I have decided that this post is worth
writing.</p></div>

                    “Veridis Quo” is a bit of clever wordplay on the
                    Latin phrase “Quo vadis?”, literally, “Whither goest
                    thou?” or “Where are you going?”. The greater
                    meaning of the phrase is, “To what purpose?” or, “To
                    what end are you doing this?” There is a Christian
                    usage of this phrase, asked to Jesus. Read in a
                    slightly different way, it reads, dis-quo-very - the
                    name of the album and also “disco very” - which can
                    also be a worthy motivation from the list of
                    available motivations for doing anything.<a
