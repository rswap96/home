            <p><p><strong>Given that things are worth doing</strong> and
one is skilled, honest and brave enough to pursue action, there are
three fundamental questions that need to be addressed - what, why and
how to go about this often noble - but always valiant - enterprise of
action.</p>
<p>The <strong>What</strong> is an important question in that it
reflects what the doer deems as the most pertinent and valuable thing to
do among all the things that can be done. The hero then refers
established wisdom, seeks mentorship and summons the internet to devise
a plan of action - the <strong>How</strong>. This scheming, popularly
perceived as one of the most important things, often amounts to very
little (if anything), because thinking is worth nothing and doing is
worth everything.</p>
<p>In this post, I argue that the most pertinent question to dwell upon
is <strong>Why</strong>[^1] - or the correct motivations for action. We
will evaluate all the popular <u>ends</u> and decide which ends align
best with our set of values. Not all values are worth the same and I
make a case for my top</p>
<p>Obviously the ideal thing to do would be to just skip this post and
all the mental masturbation, turn off the internet and get right down to
some action, but you are here and I have decided that this post is worth
writing.</p></p>
