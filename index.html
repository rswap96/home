<p>Given that things are worth doing and one is skilled, honest and
brave enough to pursue action, there are three fundamental questions
that need to be addressed - <strong>what, why and how</strong> to go
about this often noble - but always valiant - enterprise of action.</p>
<p>The <strong>What</strong> is an important question in that it
reflects what the doer deems as the most pertinent and valuable thing to
do among all the things that can be done. The hero then refers
established wisdom, seeks mentorship and summons the internet to devise
a plan of action - the <strong>How</strong>. This scheming, popularly
perceived as one of the most important things, often amounts to very
little (if anything), because thinking is worth nothing and doing is
worth everything.</p>
<p>In this post, I argue that the cardinal question to dwell upon is
<strong>Why</strong>[^1] - or the correct motivations for action. <span
style="color: darkred;"> <strong>Note that this is different from that
existential question of “Why do things when nothing
matters”</strong></span>. We will evaluate all the popular <u>ends</u>
and decide:</p>
<ul class="incremental">
<li>Which <u>ends</u> are more <u>valuable</u> than others (yes, some
ends are, in fact, objectively, <strong>greater</strong> than other
ends)</li>
<li>Which <u>value systems</u> are <u>superior</u></li>
</ul>
<p>I compare my findings with another popular mode of operation - the
famous <u>Fucking Around and Finding Out [FAFO]</u>. FAFO is
complementary to my recommendation because FAFOing ensures that ends
are, at least, not wrong. But I have noticed that nobody FAFOs without
being affected by other sinister and plebian aims that slowly and surely
seep in.</p>
<p>I will also touch upon why I think a well-formulated, individualistic
value system is indispensable for leading a meaningful life. All of
this, ultimately, rests upon the assumption that you are interested in
leading a meaningful life and that such a life actually exists.</p>
<p><u><strong>Regardless of everything</strong></u> - action is sacred
and it should be preferred over all kinds of non-action, irrespective of
whether you have a system of values or a set of higher ends or a mode of
operation.</p></p>
